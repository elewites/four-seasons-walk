# Four Seasons Walk

Four Seasons Walk is a program organized by Better Environmentally Sound Transportation (BEST [https://www.best.bc.ca/]). The Living Streets Division organizes  walks for all ages and abilities to improve mental health, reduce depression, and fight social isolation. This program offers the benefits of fostering spaces for newcomers to meet, explore their community, and learn how to use public transit and other alternatives to driving.

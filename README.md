# Four Seasons Walk

The Four Seasons Walk program, led by Better Environmentally Sound Transportation [BEST](https://www.best.bc.ca/), arranges walks for people of all ages and abilities to boost mental health, combat loneliness, and foster community connections. It's a chance for newcomers to explore their neighborhood and learn about different ways of getting around besides driving.


### Visualizations 

This code analyzes data from the 2022 Four Seasons Walk to create easy-to-understand visuals for a technical report on the program:

- **Annual Participant Mobility**: Shows how participants traveled to event sites.
- **Mode of Transportation per Site**: Displays how people got to each event location.
- **Familiarity with Event Site**: Indicates how many participants knew the site before the walk.
- **Preference for Commute Route**: Shows if participants would use the same route to return to the event site.
